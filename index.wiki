# This page is completely hand-written, color scheme is at discretion, either ;)
# IE guys' hell here :(
# "border-image" is cool, isn't it?
# If you are lucky, a Google Search bar on the up right corner would be there. Go for it!
# I feel it's pretty nice of the "Catalog" box (try Shift + Z to hide/display).
# Embeded Disqus service.
# This site would be good while using an Explorer with the Webkit core.
